## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**`Backend Software Developer Engineer`**

I'm a software engineer with over 4 years of experience, I have experience working in Backend and embedded systems.

During my Software Engineering career, I have worked with multiple programming languages, libraries, frameworks and technologies such as Java, SpringBoot, Python, C++, C, Docker. 

My interests range from distributed systems, microservices, big data to AI, and I'm always eager to explore new technological horizons.

All projects in this repo are built from the ground up. Solving some problems that I face in my daily life or just to practice
other technologies that caught my interest.
